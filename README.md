# CitationNetworkAnalysis  

This project analyzes citation networks by fetching research papers of professors from any institute or department using the **Semantic Scholar API**. It computes **centrality measures** like **degree, betweenness, and closeness** to evaluate academic influence and visualizes the network.  

## How It Works  
1. Enter a name of professor/s.  
2. Fetch research papers and citation data via **Semantic Scholar API**.  
3. Construct a citation network and compute centrality metrics.  
4. Visualize relationships between authors and publications.
